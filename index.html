    I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. People are fond of my pragmatic nature. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine. My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new individuals who are jolly to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I can resist anything except temptation for learning as I believe every day is a new opportunity to find your next milestone. People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day. Forget love! I would rather fall in chocolates.</p>

        <h3 class="orange-highlight">2020-2021| Programming Hero Learner</h3>

        <p>For being a baby web developer, they did not offer me a job. But I trained myself under their supervision as a beginner developer. We created our own portfolios, personal website and few projects. You can ask for their reviews about me. Their team uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero. Kudos to them.
